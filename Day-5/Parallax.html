        SRT provides connection and control, reliable transmission similar to
        TCP; however, it does so at the application layer, using UDP protocol as
        an underlying transport layer. It supports packet recovery while
        maintaining low latency (default: 120 ms). SRT also supports encryption
        using AES.

      The protocol was derived from the UDT project,[1] which was designed for
      fast file transmission. It provided the reliability mechanism by utilising
      similar methods for connection, sequence numbers, acknowledgements and
      re-transmission of lost packets. It utilises selective and immediate
      (NAK-based) re-transmission. SRT added several features on top of that in
      order to support live streaming mode: Controlled latency, with source time
      transmission (timestamp-based packet delivery) Relaxed sender speed
      control Conditional "too late" packet dropping (prevents head-of-line
      blocking caused by a lost packet that wasn't recovered on time) Eager
      packet re-transmission (periodic NAK-report)
